First install chrome, vscode, python, git & nodejs on windows

then copy the files (`input.csv` & `index.py`) & install the following dependencies:

`pip install seleniumbase lxml bs4 firebase-admin google-generativeai`


use ubuntu, no need for windows
systemctl to rerun the index file, the code itself ins't going to loop through the csv file


if the error happened (where its not loggin in), then delete the profiles folder (or that profile name the profiles folder)



# Important


update the `userId` if we are running it for a new client
